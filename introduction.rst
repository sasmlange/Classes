Introduction
==========================================

.. rubric:: What are Classes?

Classes define an object. They define its methods and variables.
We will learn more about objects and classes later on.

.. rubric:: What skills will I need and what will I learn?

You must have Python skills. You also must know how a function works,
By the end of this tutorial you will have learned how to use and make a class.

.. rubric:: Why do I want to learn how to use and make classes?

If you want to do something over and over again and do not want to define your
variables and functions again, it is time to use a class. We will talk more about
this in next chapters.

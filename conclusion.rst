Conclusion
=============

In this tutorial we learned how to make a class, a method, and class variables.
We also now know how to make a class that extends off another class.


Where to go from here? It is up to you. You can continue to explore the
possibility of python classes or start building your own class for your own
program.



Happy Coding!
